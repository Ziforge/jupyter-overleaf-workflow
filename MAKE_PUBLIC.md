# Install twine
pip install twine build

# Build package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

Then users can:
```bash
pip install jupyter-overleaf-workflow
```

### Create Video Tutorial

Record screencast showing:
1. Installation
2. Running example notebook
3. Converting to LaTeX
4. Syncing to Overleaf
5. Pushing to GitHub

Upload to YouTube with link in README.

### Write Blog Post
